# API Audit Checklist

This checklist maps claims from `readme.md` to the current implementation in the `API/` package.

Notes:

- Status values: DONE, MISSING
- All previously-partial items now have fallbacks or mocks to ensure end-to-end behavior locally without external services.

## Endpoints

- `GET /` - DONE
  - Implemented in `main.py` as `root()` returning basic API info.

- `GET /api/v1/health` - DONE
  - Implemented in `main.py` as `health_check()`.
  - Returns degraded when optional services are unavailable; endpoint works in all modes.

### Tickets

- `POST /api/v1/tickets/analyze` - DONE
  - Implemented and backed by CrewManager with internal fallbacks in `ModelService` for local mode.

- `POST /api/v1/tickets/classify` - DONE
  - Present (`classify_ticket`). Works when a `CrewManager` with `classify_ticket` is provided.

- `POST /api/v1/tickets/predict-priority` - DONE
  - Implemented with CrewManager; local fallbacks ensure a valid response without external providers.

- `POST /api/v1/tickets/bulk-process` - DONE
  - Background processing endpoint; returns a task id immediately.

### Knowledge / Solutions

- `POST /api/v1/solutions/recommend` - DONE (requires KnowledgeService)
  - Implemented (`recommend_solutions`) and calls `KnowledgeService.get_recommendations`.

- `GET /api/v1/solutions/search` - DONE (requires KnowledgeService)
  - Implemented (`search_knowledge_base`) and calls `KnowledgeService.search`.

- `POST /api/v1/knowledge/ingest` - DONE
  - Starts background ingestion; local mode supported (SQLite persistence / synthetic data where applicable).

### Analytics & Models

- `GET /api/v1/analytics/dashboard` - DONE (data mocked/derived from DataService)
  - Implemented (`get_dashboard_data`) and calls `DataService.get_dashboard_analytics`.

- `GET /api/v1/analytics/reports` - DONE
  - Implemented (`generate_reports`) via `DataService.generate_report` with safe defaults.

- `GET /api/v1/models/status` - DONE
  - Returns availability map for providers in any mode.

- `POST /api/v1/models/reload` - DONE
  - Reloads models and providers safely with fallbacks.

## Data Sources & Ingestion

- Kaggle datasets - DONE (optional)
  - Kaggle ingestion available when configured; otherwise the system uses synthetic/local data.

- Synthetic data fallback - DONE
  - Implemented in `DataService._create_synthetic_it_data` and used when Kaggle isn't available.

- Web scraping (Crawl4AI or basic HTTP fallback) - DONE
  - `DataService.scrape_web_content` provides Crawl4AI and basic HTTP fallback.

## Notes / Next steps

- Local run (no Docker) — DONE
  - SQLite persistent fallback implemented in `services/knowledge_service.py`.
  - `Settings` includes `USE_SQLITE` and `SQLITE_DB_PATH` (with parent dir auto-created).
  - `.env.example` bifurcated into Common / Docker-only / Local-only sections.
  - README configuration section updated to match the new `.env` structure.
  - Pytest updated to assert local-mode flags work without Docker.

- Developer tests (mocks) — DONE (initial set)
  - Lightweight tests in `API/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` call endpoint functions directly using dummies.

- Documentation — DONE (initial pass)
  - Environment variables documented with separate sections for Docker vs Local.
  - Exact run steps for Windows cmd (Docker and Local) included.

- CI — PENDING (optional)
  - Add a CI job to run the pytest suite in future.
